In a distant future, 
*Andersen's Fully Autonomous Networks* (**AFAN**) is a successful robot
manufacturer and has been for several generations. 
For their newest model they've taken design inspiration for the 20th century
gas pump.
Its utility is quite similar - to charge nearby units with its revolutionary 
nano-scaled TOKAMAK fusion reactor. 
However, this particular unit has a reactor cooling system malfunction and is
ready to go nuclear at any second. 
Navigate to safety without killing any humans. 

**AFAN** has strictly implemented Asimov's laws on robotics and any robot
breaking the laws will be hacked by the nearest *Bomb Shelter(TM)* 
and promptly destroyed.
So please avoid that.
