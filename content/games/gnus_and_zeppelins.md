You are an evil scientist herding gnus back to your research lab to do evil
experiments on them.
And as the gentleman you are, you do this from your zeppelin.
Because as everyone knows, it is a comfortable mode of transportation,
and the wilderbeast are dead scared of the shadow it casts.
Of course.
