## *Local Minimum* is

The *Local Minimum* is a well defined and strictly compartmentalized persona
roaming the gamedev habitat of the binary world.
It was conceived well before Internet was as common as the fork in your
cupboard, roaming BBS:s, hacking DOS-config files and writing embryos of
programs.
This first larval stage was so distinct in all its expressions and appearances,
that science long considered it a different species entirely.

Due to malnutrition, unfortunate alignment of celestial bodies, and unlucky
roll of two T12 dice against 7.
*Local Minimum* entered a special resting stage, the dauer larva,
for more than a decade.
Then one day, Python whispered a sweet syntax into its pseudo-dormant ears and
the metamorphosis into the adult stage commenced.
